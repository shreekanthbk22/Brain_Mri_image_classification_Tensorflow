<h2>tumored image classifier</h2><br/>
<p>A web application that classifies MRI images based on the category
of the tumor using a machine learning model that is trained using
a convolutional neural network. A Final year project successfully
integrated classifying machine-learning model to frontend.</p><br/>
Front end: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery<br/>

Backend: Python, Flask, jinja<br/>

libraries: Tensorflow
